5 // if a user restores a backup that has already been restored on their computer, decided against asking them whether its ok to delete everything that was there from their last restore before blowing it away.  It is necessary to be blown away frist otherwise the untar progress % complete will intially show greater than 100%.  This is relative to the line in the restore binary
//<<tab0<<"rm -rf "<<restorePath<<endl

6 // When restoring a large backup with lots of directories, there is concern over whether the untar progress % complete could be done within 1 second.  Decided not to take action.  Here is the block of code in actOnTarStatus that deals with this-
//else // purpose == "restore"
//Notes:
//if what is being restored is large and has lots of directories
//the below may not finish within 1 second.
//examples)
//[1]
//did 6gb directory ($HOME/temp/test/test).  it had very few
//directories so it easily finsihed within 1 second
//[2]
//did 64Gb directory ($HOME/temp) which had many subdirectories
//from the command line, this took many seconds.  by running the
//below on such a large directory the behavior of the below code
//is unknown.  At best it just might not print any % complete
//at each second, however than the user may deduce that it is
//hung when its not.  At worst, it would print something unknown
//consider testing this.
//Tested with 150MB backup.  it worked perfect.  Its possible
//that even with large backups with lots of directories that this
//would work fine since it would know what it just restored to that point
//and wouldn't have to think about it - the same way as du -sb command
//twice on $HOME/temp is very fast the second time

7 // remove scott from all source code

8 // for now not going to consider proxy server support 

9 // in install.sh at the beginning, let the user know that backup and restore are binaries that will be copied into /usr/local/bin and is it ok to proceed?
// Reason didn't do this:  nothing is currently in the 16.04 or 18.04 repo that is a binary called backup or restore

10 // change EXIT_SUCCESS to EXIT_FAILURE when the program didn't finish like it should have

11 // Capitalize the start of comments.  Didn't do this.  No real upside and some comments are even complete sentences
