# Client Side Encrypted Backups

Easy to use and zero chance of corruption.

## Overview

There are a number of encrypted backup programs available, however most can't prevent the possibility of creating a corrupt backup.  Client-Side-Encrypted-Backups always produces reliable backups.  Since corruption is not possible with Client-Side-Encrypted-Backups, only one full backup is needed (the first time you do a backup).

## Requirements

- A computer running Linux
- Access to a sftp server (in the cloud, at your office, in your house, anywhere).  This is were your backups will be stored.  If you don't have access to one, you can create an account at CloudBuddy (https://cloudbuddy.cloud).

## Usage
	To backup
	```bash
		> backup label-name|no-label
	```
